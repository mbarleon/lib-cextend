### **Preamble**
We'd like to remind you that the **LIB-CEXTEND** project is an open-source project whose base was developed over a weekend, so it may contain a few bugs.

---

### **I) Reporting bugs**

Bugs must be reported on GitHub, directly via the project issues. You'll find a form called "bug report" to be filled in with the following information:

- **The title**: please include the word **BUG**
- **A short description** of the bug
- **A description of when the bug occurred / how to reproduce it**
- **What you think should have happened** instead of the bug
- **Additional documents**: error codes, screenshots, etc.
- **Comments (optional)**: An additional comment on the bug, what you'd like to say

---

### **II) New feature proposal**

Proposals for new features must also follow a pre-established template on GitHub, in the project issues, with the following information:

- **Title**: Please indicate **NEW_FEAT**
- **Description**: Describe what you want to add to the game
- **Interest**: What do you think this would bring to the project?
- **Comment (optional)**: A personal comment

---

### **III) Discussions**

Within our project, we have created a discussion (directly on GitHub). It allows contributors, future contributors and users to exchange ideas.

You'll find different rooms, with different topics, some official like **"Announcements"**, which will concern game updates and new features, or others in which you can exchange, like **"Ideas"**, where you can submit an idea to the community, and look at the evolutions that are possible to add to it, before making an official issue.

**ATTENTION**: You must still respect the **code of conduct** within project discussions, so that everyone feels at ease within **LIB-CEXTEND**.

---

### **IV) Execution environment**

The attached code should be executed as follows:
More details on the README.md file.

```bash
./build.sh
```

---

### **V) Project development direction**

The reason we're making this project open source is, on the one hand, to create a game accessible to all, but on the other, as a means of adding more content. Indeed, we want the project to evolve by continually implementing new features for **LIB-CEXTEND**.

So we're looking forward to the majority of contributions in this direction, at least to get our project off the ground. Thanks in advance to those who will participate.

### **VI) Contact for contributors**

The contributors can be reached via the **discussions on GitHub**, and will reply as far as possible. Please do **not attempt to contact us via our e-mail addresses.**
