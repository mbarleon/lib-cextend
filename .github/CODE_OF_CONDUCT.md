LIB-CEXTEND: CODE OF CONDUCT

If you're reading this text, it's because you intend to play / participate / help with the LIB-CEXTEND project, and for that, on behalf of all collaborators, THANK YOU!

Preamble

The code of conduct should never be used in an open source project like this, which advocates development and cooperation between its members. But as GitHub likes to remind us, it's an integral part of open source projects. And even if none of us feel like using it, one day we surely will. So, in the spirit of never using this code of conduct, we're creating it to preserve the project, and create a safe and welcoming environment for all.

I) Discussions, collaboration?

As previously stated, discussions between our members have been created for cooperation and team development. Our aim? That you can develop, have fun, and get feedback from people perhaps more experienced than you, or that you can help others.

All forms of discrimination (racial, religious, etc.) have no place here, and will result in sanctions (see sanctions). We believe that every opinion, whatever the person and their knowledge (developer, user, ...) has a say, and divergent opinions not only complete the game, but also show everyone the different points of view faced with the same situation. You'll see, we'll all come out the better for it.

II) Pull request

The project is open-source, and is protected by a license (GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007) which protects our/your code from any attempt at commercialization. So, anyone is free to request a pull request, modify or add content to the game. However, your code must:

Be readable and understandable by the majority of other contributors

Be consistent with the project objective

Respect other project instructions (see collaboration guidelines)

III) Violation of the code of conduct

Has a member breached this code of conduct? Let us know immediately! Go to project issues and make a WARN request. Follow the established template, and attach evidence to your accusation, to add credence to it. For your part, don't react, just stay calm. Once the issue has been sent, you'll be sure to be considered as soon as possible, so there's no need to continue down the path of the wrongdoer and risk being the subject of a WARN.

IV) Sanctions

We take no pleasure in applying sanctions to our contributors, only that it may sometimes be necessary for the good of the project. Thus, the main contributors (@mbarleon, @OkotEgarim, and @CorpsB) can apply sanctions to our members. These sanctions may vary depending on the situation, and it's up to these main contributors to decide which sanction to apply, always with a view to preserving the project, and making it enjoyable for EVERYONE.

Nevertheless, the main sanctions that can be applied are as follows:

Private warning

Public warning

Each push will have to go through another contributor who will validate the new code

Temporary ban from the project

Permanent ban from the project

V) Main contributors

The original contributors to the project (@mbarleon) reserve the right:

Update these terms and conditions without prior notice

Apply sanctions ranging from public warnings to permanent bans, and any other sanctions that may prove necessary

Choose between different project guidelines at any time
